##### ASSIGNMENT ITERAOTR 1:
### implement a class Range, that behaves like python's range

####    Range(N) => 0 to N-1
####    Range(i, j) => i to j-1
####    Range(i, j, step) => {i, i+step, i+2*step}


####   for i in Range(10):
#          print(i)
##
#
####   must be repeatable after finish
###### must NOT have a pre-stored sequence: only lower and upper limits
